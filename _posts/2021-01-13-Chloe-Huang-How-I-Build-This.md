For me learning how to program is really a low speed way. The first idea jumping into my mind is how to build up a personal website from scratch. By investing bunch of time diving into tutorials and web posts, I find it is impossible for me to build up a website with functions I want. My way to explore coding was from the tutorial on web, which is about build up a static web page with hugo. Following the video, I created a website, but without enough knowledge I have little control of what I have made. So I purchased a fullstack web develop programs hoping to be a real builder. After the program, I build up knowledge on html, css, and javascript. But I still find it was not so easy to host a website with every piece of function that I want. After a while, I came back to github pages and tried to focus more on the contents instead of trying to build a fancy website with lots of pages and functions which are too much for me. 
With the help of following guidance, I created this website which host blogs with little effort and easy to control.

Just several hours, i have built this site following guidance from <a src="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/">JONATHAN MCGLONE</a>

Following this post, I build a personal webpage which I can fully understand each piece of the code. It is easy to maintain with simple style.

Apart from that, I also add some functions including google analytics and pagination functions.
