Today I have finished studying R and training on Adobe Illustrator. 

This post is to summarise what I have learnned from materials including books and online courses. 

Book: Adobe Illustrator CC- recent version would be ok.

Review: When I was trying to find solutions to manipulate charts and graphs exported from R, I was really amazed on the skills people use to further refine these charts. During the courses of R, I leanred the tools inkscape and tried to extend my skills with Adobe Illustrators(AI).

AI was a tool whihc I have been used occationally to created project posters in college. At that time I just quickly googled what i want and followed tutorials to make things done with minimal knowledge.
